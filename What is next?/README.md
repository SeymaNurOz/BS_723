WHAT IS NEXT?

Video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_WBuBqS9h8&t=1s

Def: Coming straight after somebody/something in time, order or space

present  --> known

next        --> unknown

*Since, present is the next of the previous--analogy
present(previous)  --> known

next(present)          --> known


In the video;
There are many statical things like plants above the camera,near the street , buildings, electric poles, asphalt.
Addition to that the parked cars are generally staying where they are.
Consequantly, we can assume that, they will stay in the next ..
But there are vehiclers and pedesterians, pets are entering and leaving from the frame.


->Objects block view time to time
->I focused the types of the things(car,pedesterian etc.) passing through or entering the roads. (Just moving ones)

15 sec intervals
4*5=20 interval

Counting the things in that 20 frames, and analyzing.
